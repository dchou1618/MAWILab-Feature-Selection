# Causal Inference Notes

1. **Causal Inference Without Models** - In the case of discrete outcomes, if we can access the outcome of a subject with and without treatment *A*, then we can access whether there was a causal effect. With notation, we can define what a causal effect on an individual means: Suppose that $$Y^{a=1}$$ is the outcome of survival for a subject if they did receive treatment $A$.
