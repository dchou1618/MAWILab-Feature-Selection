# Causal Inference Notes

**Causal Inference Without Models**
1. In the case of discrete outcomes, if we can access the outcome of a subject with and without treatment *A*, then we can access whether there was a causal effect. With notation, we can define what a causal effect on an individual means: Suppose that $Y^{a=1}$ is the outcome of survival for a subject if they did receive treatment $A$. Then $Y^{a=1} \neq Y^{a=0}$ indicates a causal effect. Individual causal effects cannot be observed because of missing data from one of the two $Y$ counterfactual outcomes. Our *assumption* with counterfactual outcomes is that they cannot interfere with one another. Otherwise, outcomes would not be well-defined and would need to be qualified with statements indicating "no interaction between units", for instance.
2. Instead of comparing discrete outcomes of individual causal effects, we can compare probabilities of the same outcome occurring after receiving or not receiving a treatment (an average treatment effect). By definition, an average treatment effect is present if $P[Y^{a=1}=1] \neq P[Y^{a=0}=1]$.
